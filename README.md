This was a project to put some concepts into practice which I got from reading "programming from the ground up".

Instructions to assemble and link inside.

Also its first to 9, since 9 is 57 in ascii and 58 is ":", so id need to convert multi digit numbers to strings or something like that, which i didnt do.
